title: "Don't Fly United If You Can Help It"
---

I flew United this past weekend to and from Oregon with my GF.  The four flights involved were honestly the **worst** I have ever experienced.  I was absolutely stunned at how rude the crew members were, how petty the additional fees were, and how demeaning the rules were.

Never in my flying experience have I ever been on a plane where people were forcibly prevented by crew members from using the restrooms in the class above them, and having the crew members say it was for *security reasons*.

Nor have I been on a flight where they charge you extra to check luggage, and request that you purchase food if your GF happens to be airsick and needs to calm her stomach since they do not freely provide snacks.

On the flip side, I have never seen business class sections that cushy.  Some of the seats had like 3 feet of legroom.
