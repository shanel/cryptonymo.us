My mother's mother grew up in South Dakota during the Depression.  She married my grandfather who was a nurse at the VA after the war.  They had little money, but ended up having six mouths to feed (their own included).  So they did their best.  They bought cheap cuts of meat, they bought in bulk when it was least expensive, and they drank instant iced tea.

Growing up in an environment like that usually has one of two effects on a child when they become an adult:

1. They continue the mentality and are spendthrifts.
2. They spend until they can't spend any more.

My mother fell into the first category.  Even though we were financially well off, my mother's mentality towards spending was to only buy things when they were on sale.  Not unsurprisingly this mentality found its way into her menus.

Although I can remember regular trips to Jack-In-The-Box to buy ten or twenty Jumbo Jacks when they were on sale (so that they could be frozen and reheated later - having found I hated microwaved lettuce and tomatoes I would strip them off before reheating) I think the most exemplary meal my mother made was fried chicken [gizzards][1] and hearts.

[Gizzards][1] and hearts are [offal][2] or *tertiary cuts*, and as such are very cheap.  Early on in my childhood I would recall recoiling in horror from eating the gizzards due to their characteristic crunchy-grittiness, but being willing to eat the hearts with minimal complaint.  As time went on though I would grow to like the gizzards...  I am not so sure this was because my tastes changed, or if as I grew older, the taste and the texture would bring me back to a simpler time in my life.

I wonder sometimes if our taste truly "matures," or if in actuality we begin to eat what we didn't eat in our youth explicitly because it reminds us of our past - whether we think fondly of that past or not...
