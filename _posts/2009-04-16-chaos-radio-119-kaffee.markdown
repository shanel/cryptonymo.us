Some of the things I've learnt: women have a greater ability to detect odours and smells ([women nose ahead in smell tests](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1796447.stm)), there's a big coffee subculture on the internet (sometimes with invite-only forums), engineers in Stanford have constructed a $11000 crazy-ass coffee maker called clover ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntbVGGMu_Ac)), detailed physics of [latte art/etching](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonx/sets/48921/), german-style filter coffee (often looked down on by italians) is making its comeback, and the fashionable latte macchiato was originally a children's drink.
