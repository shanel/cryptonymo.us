The yellow PostIt notes have been piling up on my desk at work, so it is time to get back into GTD form.  I am going to go the analog route this time I think.  I had a spare [moleskine](http://www.moleskineus.com/pocket.html) lying around so I decided to look around online for the suggested ways of making that work.  I found a few, but finally decided on [this](http://socialuxe.com/2006/11/hacking-a-gtd-moleskine/).  So I dashed out to the neighborhood stationary store and picked up the PostIt tabs and Sharpie required and slapped one together.

It is prepped and ready to go, though I have yet to put anything in it yet since I don't really have much pressing right this moment.  I am sure something will come up though.
