This is the source code for generating the blog running on [cryptonymo.us](http://cryptonymo.us). It needs a version of [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) supporting haml layouts, see [Henrik Nyh's](http://henrik.nyh.se) repo on [github.com/henrik/jekyll](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll). 

## credits

Jekyll was created by [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/). Most of the code plumbing everything together is based on Henrik's customised jekyll-based site [henrik.nyh.se](http://github.com/henrik/henrik.nyh.se/) (haml, disqus, twitter integration etc). Thanks Henrik!

The layout is based on Harry Roberts's excellent [typogridphy](http://csswizardry.com/typogridphy/).
